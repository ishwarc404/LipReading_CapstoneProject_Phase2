## This is the database creation folder.
## The code here when run, basically used to record and store frames for different words.

## You need to manually sort out the words. Hence a suggestion is to record similar words together and then manually copy paste.

1. Just run the main.py and click enter to start
2. Speak the word
3. Click enter to stop again.

#### Preferably speak the word under 30 frames.

Have fun


# Questions 
1. Do we neeed to resize the frames while taking them in ? Or should we resize them later while building the model ?
